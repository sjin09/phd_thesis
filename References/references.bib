  abstract = "Tobacco smoking increases the risk of at least 17 classes of
              human cancer. We analyzed somatic mutations and DNA methylation
              in 5243 cancers of types for which tobacco smoking confers an
              elevated risk. Smoking is associated with increased mutation
              burdens of multiple distinct mutational signatures, which
              contribute to different extents in different cancers. One of
              these signatures, mainly found in cancers derived from tissues
              directly exposed to tobacco smoke, is attributable to
              misreplication of DNA damage caused by tobacco carcinogens.
              Others likely reflect indirect activation of DNA editing by
              APOBEC cytidine deaminases and of an endogenous clocklike
              mutational process. Smoking is associated with limited
              differences in methylation. The results are consistent with the
              proposition that smoking increases cancer risk by increasing the
              somatic mutation load, although direct evidence for this
              mechanism is lacking in some smoking-related cancer types.",

              mechanisms against the toxic effects of cisplatin. An in vitro
              excision repair assay employing mammalian cell-free extracts was
              used to determine that the 1,2-d(ApG) intrastrand cross-link, a
              prevalent cisplatin-DNA adduct, is excised by the excinuclease
              from a site-specifically modified oligonucleotide 156 base pairs
              in length. Repair of the minor interstrand d(G)/d(G) cross-link
              was not detected by using this system. Proteins containing the
              high mobility group (HMG) domain DNA-binding motif, in
              particular, rat HMG1 and a murine testis-specific HMG-domain
              protein, specifically inhibit excision repair of the intrastrand
              1,2-d(GpG) and -d(ApG) cross-links. This effect was also
              exhibited by a single HMG domain from HMG1. Similar inhibition of
              repair of a site-specific 1,2-d(GpG) intrastrand cross-link by an
              HMG-domain protein also occurred in a reconstituted system

              that HMG-domain proteins can block excision repair of the major

              contribute to the unique sensitivity of certain tumors to the
              drug. The reconstituted excinuclease was more efficient at
              excising the 1,3-d(GpTpG) intrastrand adduct than either the

              cancer chemotherapy may cause secondary malignancies as well as
              contribute to the evolution of treatment-resistant tumour cells.
              The stable diploid genome of the chicken DT40 lymphoblast cell
              line, an established DNA repair model system, is well suited to
              accurately assay genomic mutations. RESULTS: We use whole genome
              sequencing of multiple DT40 clones to determine the mutagenic
              effect of eight common cytotoxics used for the treatment of
              millions of patients worldwide. We determine the spontaneous
              mutagenesis rate at 2.3 $\times$ 10(-10) per base per cell
              division and find that cisplatin, cyclophosphamide and etoposide
              induce extra base substitutions with distinct spectra. After four
              cycles of exposure, cisplatin induces 0.8 mutations per Mb,
              equivalent to the median mutational burden in common leukaemias.
              Cisplatin-induced mutations, including short insertions and
              deletions, are mainly located at sites of putative intrastrand
              crosslinks. We find two of the newly defined cisplatin-specific
              mutation types as causes of the reversion of BRCA2 mutations in
              emerging cisplatin-resistant tumours or cell clones. Gemcitabine,
              5-fluorouracil, hydroxyurea, doxorubicin and paclitaxel have no
              measurable mutagenic effect. The cisplatin-induced mutation
              spectrum shows good correlation with cancer mutation signatures
              attributed to smoking and other sources of guanine-directed base
              damage. CONCLUSION: This study provides support for the use of
              cell line mutagenesis assays to validate or predict the mutagenic
              effect of environmental and iatrogenic exposures. Our results
              suggest genetic reversion due to cisplatin-induced mutations as a
              distinct mechanism for developing resistance.",

               CPDs cause mutations is unclear. To map CPDs at single-base
               resolution genome wide, we developed the circle damage

               cytosine deamination, we specifically mapped UVB-induced

              equivalent data for normal bronchial cells are lacking. Here we
              sequenced whole genomes of 632 colonies derived from single
              bronchial epithelial cells across 16 subjects. Tobacco smoking
              was the major influence on mutational burden, typically adding
              from 1,000 to 10,000 mutations per cell; massively increasing the

              and deletions. A population of cells in individuals with a
              history of smoking had mutational burdens that were equivalent to

              affecting 4-14\% of cells in middle-aged subjects who had never
              smoked. In current smokers, at least 25\% of cells carried driver
              mutations and 0-6\% of cells had two or even three drivers. Thus,
              tobacco smoking increases mutational burden, cell-to-cell
              heterogeneity and driver mutations, but quitting promotes
              replenishment of the bronchial epithelium from mitotically
              quiescent cells that have avoided tobacco mutagenesis.",

              repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) frequently correlates
              with increased junctional microhomology. However, alt-EJ also
              produces junctions without microhomology (apparent blunt joins),
              and the exact role of microhomology in both alt-EJ and classical
              non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) remains unclear. To better
              understand the degree to which alt-EJ depends on annealing at
              pre-existing microhomologies, we examined inaccurate repair of an
              I-SceI DSB lacking nearby microhomologies of greater than four
              nucleotides in Drosophila. Lig4 deficiency affected neither
              frequency nor length of junctional microhomology, but
              significantly increased insertion frequency. Many insertions
              appeared to be templated. Based on sequence analysis of repair
              junctions, we propose a model of synthesis-dependent

              junctional microhomologies and short indels (deletion with
              insertion) are often considered to reflect different repair
              mechanisms. However, a majority of each type had structures
              consistent with the predictions of our SD-MMEJ model. This
              suggests that a single underlying mechanism could be responsible
              for all three repair product types. Genetic analysis indicates

              genetic variation, here we sequence and analyse a haploid human
              genome (CHM1) using single-molecule, real-time DNA sequencing. We
              close or extend 55\% of the remaining interstitial gaps in the
              human GRCh37 reference genome--78\% of which carried long runs of
              degenerate short tandem repeats, often several kilobases in
              length, embedded within (G+C)-rich genomic regions. We resolve
              the complete sequence of 26,079 euchromatic structural variants
              at the base-pair level, including inversions, complex insertions
              and long tracts of tandem repeats. Most have not been previously
              reported, with the greatest increases in sensitivity occurring
              for events less than 5 kilobases in size. Compared to the human
              reference, we find a significant insertional bias (3:1) in
              regions corresponding to complex insertions and long short tandem
              repeats. Our results suggest a greater complexity of the human
              genome in the form of variation of longer and more complex
              repetitive DNA that can now be largely resolved with the
              application of this longer-read sequencing technology.",

  abstract = "De novo genome assembly provides comprehensive, unbiased genomic information and makes it possible to gain insight into new DNA sequences not present in reference genomes. Many de novo human genomes have been published in the last few years, leveraging a combination of inexpensive short-read and single-molecule long-read technologies. As long-read DNA sequencers become more prevalent, the computational burden of generating assemblies persists as a critical factor. The most common approach to long-read assembly, using an overlap-layout-consensus (OLC) paradigm, requires all-to-all read comparisons, which quadratically scales in computational complexity with the number of reads. We assert that recently achievements in sequencing technology (i.e. with accuracy ~99\% and read length ~10-15k) enables a fundamentally better strategy for OLC that is effectively linear rather than quadratic. Our genome assembly implementation, Peregrine uses sparse hierarchical minimizers (SHIMMER) to index reads thereby avoiding the need for an all-to-all read comparison step. Peregrine can assemble 30x human PacBio CCS read datasets in less than 30 CPU hours and around 100 wall-clock minutes to a high contiguity assembly (N50 > 20Mb). The continued advance of sequencing technologies coupled with the Peregrine assembler enables routine generation of human de novo assemblies. This will allow for population scale measurements of more comprehensive genomic variations -- beyond SNPs and small indels -- as well as novel applications requiring rapid access to de novo assemblies",

              with the former offering greater assembly continuity and the

              overlap-based error correction, and aggressive false overlap

  abstract = "Restriction endonuclease analysis of human genomic DNA has
              previously revealed several prominent repeated DNA families
              defined by regularly spaced enzyme recognition sites. One of
              these families, termed alpha satellite DNA, was originally
              identified as tandemly repeated 340- or 680-base pair (bp) EcoRI
              fragments that hybridize to the centromeric regions of human
              chromosomes. We have investigated the molecular organization of
              alpha satellite DNA on individual human chromosomes by filter
              hybridization and in situ hybridization analysis of human DNA and
              DNA from rodent/human somatic cell hybrids, each containing only
              a single human chromosome. We used as probes a cloned 340-bp
              EcoRI alpha satellite fragment and a cloned alpha
              satellite-containing 2.0-kilobase pair (kbp) BamHI fragment from
              the pericentromeric region of the human X chromosome. In each
              somatic cell hybrid DNA, the two probes hybridized to a distinct
              subset of DNA fragments detected in total human genomic DNA.
              Thus, alpha satellite DNA on each of the human chromosomes
              examined--the X and Y chromosomes and autosomes 3, 4, and 21--is
              organized in a specific and limited number of molecular domains.
              The data indicate that subsets of alpha satellite DNA on
              individual chromosomes differ from one another, both with respect
              to restriction enzyme periodicities and with respect to their
              degree of sequence relatedness. The results suggest that some,
              and perhaps many, human chromosomes are characterized by a
              specific organization of alpha satellite DNA at their centromeres
              and that, under appropriate experimental conditions, cloned
              representatives of alpha satellite subfamilies may serve as a new
              class of chromosome-specific DNA markers.",

  abstract = "Somatic mutations accumulate in healthy tissues as we age, giving
              rise to cancer and potentially contributing to ageing. To study
              somatic mutations in non-neoplastic tissues, we developed a
              series of protocols to sequence the genomes of small populations
              of cells isolated from histological sections. Here, we describe a
              complete workflow that combines laser-capture microdissection
              (LCM) with low-input genome sequencing, while circumventing the
              use of whole-genome amplification (WGA). The protocol is
              subdivided broadly into four steps: tissue processing, LCM,
              low-input library generation and mutation calling and filtering.
              The tissue processing and LCM steps are provided as general
              guidelines that might require tailoring based on the specific
              requirements of the study at hand. Our protocol for low-input
              library generation uses enzymatic rather than acoustic
              fragmentation to generate WGA-free whole-genome libraries.
              Finally, the mutation calling and filtering strategy has been
              adapted from previously published protocols to account for
              artifacts introduced via library creation. To date, we have used
              this workflow to perform targeted and whole-genome sequencing of
              small populations of cells (typically 100-1,000 cells) in
              thousands of microbiopsies from a wide range of human tissues.
              The low-input DNA protocol is designed to be compatible with
              liquid handling platforms and make use of equipment and expertise
              standard to any core sequencing facility. However, obtaining
              low-input DNA material via LCM requires specialized equipment and
              expertise. The entire protocol from tissue reception through
              whole-genome library generation can be accomplished in as little
              as 1 week, although 2-3 weeks would be a more typical turnaround

              mapping and introduces bias. Variation graphs are bidirected DNA
              sequence graphs that compactly represent genetic variation across
              a population, including large-scale structural variation such as
              inversions and duplications. Previous graph genome software
              implementations have been limited by scalability or topological
              constraints. Here we present vg, a toolkit of computational
              methods for creating, manipulating, and using these structures as
              references at the scale of the human genome. vg provides an
              efficient approach to mapping reads onto arbitrary variation
              graphs using generalized compressed suffix arrays, with improved
              accuracy over alignment to a linear reference, and effectively
              removing reference bias. These capabilities make using variation
              graphs as references for DNA sequencing practical at a gigabase
              scale, or at the topological complexity of de novo assemblies.",

  abstract = "New sequencing technologies promise a new era in the use of DNA
              sequence. However, some of these technologies produce very short
              reads, typically of a few tens of base pairs, and to use these
              reads effectively requires new algorithms and software. In
              particular, there is a major issue in efficiently aligning short
              reads to a reference genome and handling ambiguity or lack of
              accuracy in this alignment. Here we introduce the concept of
              mapping quality, a measure of the confidence that a read actually
              comes from the position it is aligned to by the mapping
              algorithm. We describe the software MAQ that can build assemblies
              by mapping shotgun short reads to a reference genome, using
              quality scores to derive genotype calls of the consensus sequence
              of a diploid genome, e.g., from a human sample. MAQ makes full
              use of mate-pair information and estimates the error probability
              of each read alignment. Error probabilities are also derived for
              the final genotype calls, using a Bayesian statistical model that
              incorporates the mapping qualities, error probabilities from the
              raw sequence quality scores, sampling of the two haplotypes, and
              an empirical model for correlated errors at a site. Both read
              mapping and genotype calling are evaluated on simulated data and
              real data. MAQ is accurate, efficient, versatile, and

              noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT). However, some of these DNA
              damages are potentially reparable. We aimed to recover these
              damaged cfDNA molecules using PreCR DNA repair mix. METHODS:
              cfDNA was extracted from 20 maternal plasma samples and was
              repaired and sequenced by the Illumina platform. Size profiles
              and fetal DNA fraction changes of repaired samples were
              characterized. Targeted sequencing of chromosome Y sequences was
              used to enrich fetal cfDNA molecules following repair.
              Single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing platform was employed
              to characterize long (>250 bp) cfDNA molecules. NIPT of five
              trisomy 21 samples was performed. RESULTS: Size profiles of
              repaired libraries were altered, with significantly increased
              long (>250 bp) cfDNA molecules. Single nucleotide polymorphism
              (SNP)-based analyses showed that both fetal- and maternal-derived
              cfDNA molecules were enriched by the repair. Fetal DNA fractions
              in maternal plasma showed a small but consistent (4.8\%)
              increase, which were contributed by a higher increment of long
              fetal cfDNA molecules. z-score values were improved in NIPT of
              all trisomy 21 samples. CONCLUSION: Plasma DNA repair recovers

              as severe DNA degradation. Using single molecule real-time
              sequencing, we developed a methodology to directly examine 5mC.
              This approach holistically examined kinetic signals of a DNA
              polymerase (including interpulse duration and pulse width) and
              sequence context for every nucleotide within a measurement
              window, termed the holistic kinetic (HK) model. The measurement
              window of each analyzed double-stranded DNA molecule comprised 21
              nucleotides with a cytosine in a CpG site in the center. We used
              amplified DNA (unmethylated) and M.SssI-treated DNA (methylated)
              (M.SssI being a CpG methyltransferase) to train a convolutional
              neural network. The area under the curve for differentiating
              methylation states using such samples was up to 0.97. The
              sensitivity and specificity for genome-wide 5mC detection at

              HK model was then tested on human-mouse hybrid fragments in which
              each member of the hybrid had a different methylation status. The
              model was also tested on human genomic DNA molecules extracted
              from various biological samples, such as buffy coat, placental,
              and tumoral tissues. The overall methylation levels deduced by
              the HK model were well correlated with those by BS-seq (r = 0.99;

              methylation patterns in imprinted genes. Taken together, this

              between bioinformatics tools. With the avalanche of
              next-generation sequencing data, the amount of sequence data
              being deposited and accessed in FASTA/Q formats is increasing
              dramatically. However, the existing tools have very low
              efficiency at random retrieval of subsequences due to the
              requirement of loading the entire index into memory. In addition,
              most existing tools have no capability to build index for large
              FASTA/Q files because of the limited memory. Furthermore, the
              tools do not provide support to randomly accessing sequences from
              FASTA/Q files compressed by gzip, which is extensively adopted by
              most public databases to compress data for saving storage. In
              this study, we developed pyfastx as a versatile Python package

              used for personal and cancer genomics as well as in various
              research areas. However, in the lack of an unbiased whole-genome
              truth set, the global error rate of variant calls and the leading
              causal artifacts still remain unclear even given the great
              efforts in the evaluation of variant calling methods. RESULTS: We
              made 10 single nucleotide polymorphism and INDEL call sets with
              two read mappers and five variant callers, both on a haploid
              human genome and a diploid genome at a similar coverage. By
              investigating false heterozygous calls in the haploid genome, we
              identified the erroneous realignment in low-complexity regions
              and the incomplete reference genome with respect to the sample as
              the two major sources of errors, which press for continued
              improvements in these two areas. We estimated that the error rate
              of raw genotype calls is as high as 1 in 10-15 kb, but the error

              functional decline after 70 years of age remains unclear. Here we

              haematopoietic cells across 10 human subjects from 0 to 81 years
              of age. Haematopoietic stem cells or multipotent progenitors
              (HSC/MPPs) accumulated a mean of 17 mutations per year after
              birth and lost 30 base pairs per year of telomere length.
              Haematopoiesis in adults less than 65 years of age was massively
              polyclonal, with high clonal diversity and a stable population of
              20,000-200,000 HSC/MPPs contributing evenly to blood production.
              By contrast, haematopoiesis in individuals aged over 75 showed
              profoundly decreased clonal diversity. In each of the older
              subjects, 30-60\% of haematopoiesis was accounted for by 12-18
              independent clones, each contributing 1-34\% of blood production.
              Most clones had begun their expansion before the subject was 40
              years old, but only 22\% had known driver mutations. Genome-wide
              selection analysis estimated that between 1 in 34 and 1 in 12
              non-synonymous mutations were drivers, accruing at constant rates

              population size and constant acquisition of driver mutations
              conferring moderate fitness benefits, entirely explained the
              abrupt change in clonal structure in the elderly. Rapidly
              decreasing clonal diversity is a universal feature of
              haematopoiesis in aged humans, underpinned by pervasive positive

              in around 5\% of cases no drivers were identified, suggesting
              that cancer driver discovery is not yet complete. Chromothripsis,
              in which many clustered structural variants arise in a single
              catastrophic event, is frequently an early event in tumour
              evolution; in acral melanoma, for example, these events precede
              most somatic point mutations and affect several cancer-associated
              genes simultaneously. Cancers with abnormal telomere maintenance

              show several mechanisms of preventing telomere attrition to
              critical levels. Common and rare germline variants affect

              the capacity to generate hundreds of billions of nucleotides of
              DNA sequence in a single experiment, the error rate of ~1\%
              results in hundreds of millions of sequencing mistakes. These
              scattered errors can be tolerated in some applications but become
              extremely problematic when ``deep sequencing'' genetically
              heterogeneous mixtures, such as tumors or mixed microbial
              populations. To overcome limitations in sequencing accuracy, we
              have developed a method termed Duplex Sequencing. This approach
              greatly reduces errors by independently tagging and sequencing
              each of the two strands of a DNA duplex. As the two strands are
              complementary, true mutations are found at the same position in
              both strands. In contrast, PCR or sequencing errors result in
              mutations in only one strand and can thus be discounted as
              technical error. We determine that Duplex Sequencing has a
              theoretical background error rate of less than one artifactual
              mutation per billion nucleotides sequenced. In addition, we
              establish that detection of mutations present in only one of the
              two strands of duplex DNA can be used to identify sites of DNA
              damage. We apply the method to directly assess the frequency and

  abstract = "The human reference genome assembly plays a central role in
              nearly all aspects of today's basic and clinical research. GRCh38
              is the first coordinate-changing assembly update since 2009; it
              reflects the resolution of roughly 1000 issues and encompasses
              modifications ranging from thousands of single base changes to
              megabase-scale path reorganizations, gap closures, and
              localization of previously orphaned sequences. We developed a new
              approach to sequence generation for targeted base updates and
              used data from new genome mapping technologies and single
              haplotype resources to identify and resolve larger assembly
              issues. For the first time, the reference assembly contains
              sequence-based representations for the centromeres. We also
              expanded the number of alternate loci to create a reference that
              provides a more robust representation of human population
              variation. We demonstrate that the updates render the reference
              an improved annotation substrate, alter read alignments in
              unchanged regions, and impact variant interpretation at
              clinically relevant loci. We additionally evaluated a collection
              of new de novo long-read haploid assemblies and conclude that
              although the new assemblies compare favorably to the reference
              with respect to continuity, error rate, and gene completeness,
              the reference still provides the best representation for complex
              genomic regions and coding sequences. We assert that the
              collected updates in GRCh38 make the newer assembly a more robust
              substrate for comprehensive analyses that will promote our
              understanding of human biology and advance our efforts to improve
              health.",

              importance, the difficulty of detecting mutations that are only
              present in single cells or small clones has limited our knowledge
              of somatic mutagenesis to a minority of tissues. Here, to
              overcome these limitations, we developed nanorate sequencing
              (NanoSeq), a duplex sequencing protocol with error rates of less
              than five errors per billion base pairs in single DNA molecules
              from cell populations. This rate is two orders of magnitude lower
              than typical somatic mutation loads, enabling the study of
              somatic mutations in any tissue independently of clonality. We
              used this single-molecule sensitivity to study somatic mutations
              in non-dividing cells across several tissues, comparing stem
              cells to differentiated cells and studying mutagenesis in the
              absence of cell division. Differentiated cells in blood and colon
              displayed remarkably similar mutation loads and signatures to
              their corresponding stem cells, despite mature blood cells having
              undergone considerably more divisions. We then characterized the
              mutational landscape of post-mitotic neurons and polyclonal
              smooth muscle, confirming that neurons accumulate somatic
              mutations at a constant rate throughout life without cell
              division, with similar rates to mitotically active tissues.
              Together, our results suggest that mutational processes that are
              independent of cell division are important contributors to
              somatic mutagenesis. We anticipate that the ability to reliably
              detect mutations in single DNA molecules could transform our
              understanding of somatic mutagenesis and enable non-invasive
              studies on large-scale cohorts.",

              One milestone towards this objective is the identification of all
              the genes with mutations capable of driving tumours. Since the
              1970s, the list of cancer genes has been growing steadily.
              Because cancer driver genes are under positive selection in
              tumorigenesis, their observed patterns of somatic mutations
              across tumours in a cohort deviate from those expected from
              neutral mutagenesis. These deviations, which constitute signals
              of positive selection, may be detected by carefully designed
              bioinformatics methods, which have become the state of the art in
              the identification of driver genes. A systematic approach
              combining several of these signals could lead to a compendium of
              mutational cancer genes. In this Review, we present the
              Integrative OncoGenomics (IntOGen) pipeline, an implementation of
              such an approach to obtain the compendium of mutational cancer
              drivers. Its application to somatic mutations of more than 28,000
              tumours of 66 cancer types reveals 568 cancer genes and points
              towards their mechanisms of tumorigenesis. The application of
              this approach to the ever-growing datasets of somatic tumour
              mutations will support the continuous refinement of our knowledge

              signatures. Some are present in many cancer types, notably a
              signature attributed to the APOBEC family of cytidine deaminases,
              whereas others are confined to a single cancer class. Certain
              signatures are associated with age of the patient at cancer
              diagnosis, known mutagenic exposures or defects in DNA
              maintenance, but many are of cryptic origin. In addition to these
              genome-wide mutational signatures, hypermutation localized to
              small genomic regions, 'kataegis', is found in many cancer types.
              The results reveal the diversity of mutational processes

  abstract = "MOTIVATION: Whole genome and exome sequencing of matched
              tumor-normal sample pairs is becoming routine in cancer research.
              The consequent increased demand for somatic variant analysis of
              paired samples requires methods specialized to model this problem
              so as to sensitively call variants at any practical level of
              tumor impurity. RESULTS: We describe Strelka, a method for
              somatic SNV and small indel detection from sequencing data of
              matched tumor-normal samples. The method uses a novel Bayesian
              approach which represents continuous allele frequencies for both
              tumor and normal samples, while leveraging the expected genotype
              structure of the normal. This is achieved by representing the
              normal sample as a mixture of germline variation with noise, and
              representing the tumor sample as a mixture of the normal sample
              with somatic variation. A natural consequence of the model
              structure is that sensitivity can be maintained at high tumor
              impurity without requiring purity estimates. We demonstrate that
              the method has superior accuracy and sensitivity on impure
              samples compared with approaches based on either diploid genotype
              likelihoods or general allele-frequency tests. AVAILABILITY: The
