  abstract = "MOTIVATION: Whole genome and exome sequencing of matched
              tumor-normal sample pairs is becoming routine in cancer research.
              The consequent increased demand for somatic variant analysis of
              paired samples requires methods specialized to model this problem
              so as to sensitively call variants at any practical level of
              tumor impurity. RESULTS: We describe Strelka, a method for
              somatic SNV and small indel detection from sequencing data of
              matched tumor-normal samples. The method uses a novel Bayesian
              approach which represents continuous allele frequencies for both
              tumor and normal samples, while leveraging the expected genotype
              structure of the normal. This is achieved by representing the
              normal sample as a mixture of germline variation with noise, and
              representing the tumor sample as a mixture of the normal sample
              with somatic variation. A natural consequence of the model
              structure is that sensitivity can be maintained at high tumor
              impurity without requiring purity estimates. We demonstrate that
              the method has superior accuracy and sensitivity on impure
              samples compared with approaches based on either diploid genotype
              likelihoods or general allele-frequency tests. AVAILABILITY: The

              haematopoietic cells across 10 human subjects from 0 to 81 years

              (HSC/MPPs) accumulated a mean of 17 mutations per year after
              birth and lost 30 base pairs per year of telomere length.
              Haematopoiesis in adults less than 65 years of age was massively
              polyclonal, with high clonal diversity and a stable population of
              20,000-200,000 HSC/MPPs contributing evenly to blood production.
              By contrast, haematopoiesis in individuals aged over 75 showed
              profoundly decreased clonal diversity. In each of the older
              subjects, 30-60\% of haematopoiesis was accounted for by 12-18
              independent clones, each contributing 1-34\% of blood production.
              Most clones had begun their expansion before the subject was 40
              years old, but only 22\% had known driver mutations. Genome-wide
              selection analysis estimated that between 1 in 34 and 1 in 12
              non-synonymous mutations were drivers, accruing at constant rates
              throughout life, affecting more genes than identified in blood
              cancers. Loss of the Y chromosome conferred selective benefits in
              males. Simulations of haematopoiesis, with constant stem cell
              population size and constant acquisition of driver mutations
              conferring moderate fitness benefits, entirely explained the
              abrupt change in clonal structure in the elderly. Rapidly
              decreasing clonal diversity is a universal feature of
              haematopoiesis in aged humans, underpinned by pervasive positive
              selection acting on many more genes than currently identified.",
