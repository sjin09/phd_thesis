  abstract = "Somatic mutations accumulate in healthy tissues as we age, giving
              rise to cancer and potentially contributing to ageing. To study
              somatic mutations in non-neoplastic tissues, we developed a
              series of protocols to sequence the genomes of small populations
              of cells isolated from histological sections. Here, we describe a
              complete workflow that combines laser-capture microdissection
              (LCM) with low-input genome sequencing, while circumventing the
              use of whole-genome amplification (WGA). The protocol is
              subdivided broadly into four steps: tissue processing, LCM,
              low-input library generation and mutation calling and filtering.
              The tissue processing and LCM steps are provided as general
              guidelines that might require tailoring based on the specific
              requirements of the study at hand. Our protocol for low-input
              library generation uses enzymatic rather than acoustic
              fragmentation to generate WGA-free whole-genome libraries.
              Finally, the mutation calling and filtering strategy has been
              adapted from previously published protocols to account for
              artifacts introduced via library creation. To date, we have used
              this workflow to perform targeted and whole-genome sequencing of
              small populations of cells (typically 100-1,000 cells) in
              thousands of microbiopsies from a wide range of human tissues.
              The low-input DNA protocol is designed to be compatible with
              liquid handling platforms and make use of equipment and expertise
              standard to any core sequencing facility. However, obtaining
              low-input DNA material via LCM requires specialized equipment and
              expertise. The entire protocol from tissue reception through
              whole-genome library generation can be accomplished in as little
              as 1 week, although 2-3 weeks would be a more typical turnaround
              time.",

  abstract = "New sequencing technologies promise a new era in the use of DNA
              sequence. However, some of these technologies produce very short
              reads, typically of a few tens of base pairs, and to use these
              reads effectively requires new algorithms and software. In
              particular, there is a major issue in efficiently aligning short
              reads to a reference genome and handling ambiguity or lack of
              accuracy in this alignment. Here we introduce the concept of
              mapping quality, a measure of the confidence that a read actually
              comes from the position it is aligned to by the mapping
              algorithm. We describe the software MAQ that can build assemblies
              by mapping shotgun short reads to a reference genome, using
              quality scores to derive genotype calls of the consensus sequence
              of a diploid genome, e.g., from a human sample. MAQ makes full
              use of mate-pair information and estimates the error probability
              of each read alignment. Error probabilities are also derived for
              the final genotype calls, using a Bayesian statistical model that
              incorporates the mapping qualities, error probabilities from the
              raw sequence quality scores, sampling of the two haplotypes, and
              an empirical model for correlated errors at a site. Both read
              mapping and genotype calling are evaluated on simulated data and

              damages are potentially reparable. We aimed to recover these
              damaged cfDNA molecules using PreCR DNA repair mix. METHODS:
              cfDNA was extracted from 20 maternal plasma samples and was
              repaired and sequenced by the Illumina platform. Size profiles
              and fetal DNA fraction changes of repaired samples were
              characterized. Targeted sequencing of chromosome Y sequences was
              used to enrich fetal cfDNA molecules following repair.
              Single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing platform was employed
              to characterize long (>250 bp) cfDNA molecules. NIPT of five

              repaired libraries were altered, with significantly increased
              long (>250 bp) cfDNA molecules. Single nucleotide polymorphism
              (SNP)-based analyses showed that both fetal- and maternal-derived

              fetal cfDNA molecules. z-score values were improved in NIPT of
              all trisomy 21 samples. CONCLUSION: Plasma DNA repair recovers

              sequencing, we developed a methodology to directly examine 5mC.
              This approach holistically examined kinetic signals of a DNA
              polymerase (including interpulse duration and pulse width) and
              sequence context for every nucleotide within a measurement
              window, termed the holistic kinetic (HK) model. The measurement
              window of each analyzed double-stranded DNA molecule comprised 21
              nucleotides with a cytosine in a CpG site in the center. We used
              amplified DNA (unmethylated) and M.SssI-treated DNA (methylated)
              (M.SssI being a CpG methyltransferase) to train a convolutional

              tumor-normal sample pairs is becoming routine in cancer research.
              The consequent increased demand for somatic variant analysis of
              paired samples requires methods specialized to model this problem
              so as to sensitively call variants at any practical level of
              tumor impurity. RESULTS: We describe Strelka, a method for
              somatic SNV and small indel detection from sequencing data of
              matched tumor-normal samples. The method uses a novel Bayesian
              approach which represents continuous allele frequencies for both
              tumor and normal samples, while leveraging the expected genotype
              structure of the normal. This is achieved by representing the
              normal sample as a mixture of germline variation with noise, and
              representing the tumor sample as a mixture of the normal sample
              with somatic variation. A natural consequence of the model
              structure is that sensitivity can be maintained at high tumor
              impurity without requiring purity estimates. We demonstrate that
              the method has superior accuracy and sensitivity on impure

              questions by the complexity of accessing and manipulating the
              data produced by these machines. Here, we discuss our Genome
              Analysis Toolkit (GATK), a structured programming framework

              tools for next-generation DNA sequencers using the functional

              sequenced 3,579 genomes from single cell-derived colonies of
              haematopoietic cells across 10 human subjects from 0 to 81 years
              of age. Haematopoietic stem cells or multipotent progenitors
              (HSC/MPPs) accumulated a mean of 17 mutations per year after
              birth and lost 30 base pairs per year of telomere length.
              Haematopoiesis in adults less than 65 years of age was massively
              polyclonal, with high clonal diversity and a stable population of
              20,000-200,000 HSC/MPPs contributing evenly to blood production.
              By contrast, haematopoiesis in individuals aged over 75 showed
              profoundly decreased clonal diversity. In each of the older
              subjects, 30-60\% of haematopoiesis was accounted for by 12-18
              independent clones, each contributing 1-34\% of blood production.
              Most clones had begun their expansion before the subject was 40
              years old, but only 22\% had known driver mutations. Genome-wide
              selection analysis estimated that between 1 in 34 and 1 in 12
              non-synonymous mutations were drivers, accruing at constant rates
              throughout life, affecting more genes than identified in blood
              cancers. Loss of the Y chromosome conferred selective benefits in
              males. Simulations of haematopoiesis, with constant stem cell
              population size and constant acquisition of driver mutations
              conferring moderate fitness benefits, entirely explained the
              abrupt change in clonal structure in the elderly. Rapidly
              decreasing clonal diversity is a universal feature of
              haematopoiesis in aged humans, underpinned by pervasive positive
              selection acting on many more genes than currently identified.",

              a single cell cycle. Instead, DNA lesions segregate, unrepaired,

              each of the two strands of a DNA duplex. As the two strands are
              complementary, true mutations are found at the same position in
              both strands. In contrast, PCR or sequencing errors result in
              mutations in only one strand and can thus be discounted as
              technical error. We determine that Duplex Sequencing has a
              theoretical background error rate of less than one artifactual
              mutation per billion nucleotides sequenced. In addition, we
              establish that detection of mutations present in only one of the
              two strands of duplex DNA can be used to identify sites of DNA
              damage. We apply the method to directly assess the frequency and
              pattern of random mutations in mitochondrial DNA from human
              cells.",

              is the first coordinate-changing assembly update since 2009; it
              reflects the resolution of roughly 1000 issues and encompasses
              modifications ranging from thousands of single base changes to
              megabase-scale path reorganizations, gap closures, and
              localization of previously orphaned sequences. We developed a new
              approach to sequence generation for targeted base updates and
              used data from new genome mapping technologies and single
              haplotype resources to identify and resolve larger assembly
              issues. For the first time, the reference assembly contains
              sequence-based representations for the centromeres. We also

              provides a more robust representation of human population

              clinically relevant loci. We additionally evaluated a collection

              the reference still provides the best representation for complex
              genomic regions and coding sequences. We assert that the
              collected updates in GRCh38 make the newer assembly a more robust
              substrate for comprehensive analyses that will promote our

              importance, the difficulty of detecting mutations that are only
              present in single cells or small clones has limited our knowledge
              of somatic mutagenesis to a minority of tissues. Here, to
              overcome these limitations, we developed nanorate sequencing
              (NanoSeq), a duplex sequencing protocol with error rates of less
              than five errors per billion base pairs in single DNA molecules
              from cell populations. This rate is two orders of magnitude lower
              than typical somatic mutation loads, enabling the study of
              somatic mutations in any tissue independently of clonality. We
              used this single-molecule sensitivity to study somatic mutations
              in non-dividing cells across several tissues, comparing stem
              cells to differentiated cells and studying mutagenesis in the
              absence of cell division. Differentiated cells in blood and colon
              displayed remarkably similar mutation loads and signatures to
              their corresponding stem cells, despite mature blood cells having
              undergone considerably more divisions. We then characterized the
              mutational landscape of post-mitotic neurons and polyclonal
              smooth muscle, confirming that neurons accumulate somatic
              mutations at a constant rate throughout life without cell
              division, with similar rates to mitotically active tissues.
              Together, our results suggest that mutational processes that are
              independent of cell division are important contributors to
              somatic mutagenesis. We anticipate that the ability to reliably
              detect mutations in single DNA molecules could transform our
              understanding of somatic mutagenesis and enable non-invasive
              studies on large-scale cohorts.",

              One milestone towards this objective is the identification of all
              the genes with mutations capable of driving tumours. Since the
              1970s, the list of cancer genes has been growing steadily.
              Because cancer driver genes are under positive selection in
              tumorigenesis, their observed patterns of somatic mutations
              across tumours in a cohort deviate from those expected from
              neutral mutagenesis. These deviations, which constitute signals
              of positive selection, may be detected by carefully designed
              bioinformatics methods, which have become the state of the art in
              the identification of driver genes. A systematic approach
              combining several of these signals could lead to a compendium of
              mutational cancer genes. In this Review, we present the

              tumours of 66 cancer types reveals 568 cancer genes and points
              towards their mechanisms of tumorigenesis. The application of
              this approach to the ever-growing datasets of somatic tumour

              The consequent increased demand for somatic variant analysis of
              paired samples requires methods specialized to model this problem
              so as to sensitively call variants at any practical level of

              somatic SNV and small indel detection from sequencing data of
              matched tumor-normal samples. The method uses a novel Bayesian
              approach which represents continuous allele frequencies for both
              tumor and normal samples, while leveraging the expected genotype
              structure of the normal. This is achieved by representing the
              normal sample as a mixture of germline variation with noise, and
              representing the tumor sample as a mixture of the normal sample
              with somatic variation. A natural consequence of the model

              processes. With a diversity of risk factors, liver cancer is an
              ideal model to study these interactions. Here, we analyze the
              whole genomes of 44 new and 264 published liver cancers and we
              identify 10 mutational and 6 structural rearrangement signatures

              replication, transcription, and driver genes. The liver
              cancer-specific signature 16, associated with alcohol, displays a
              unique feature of transcription-coupled damage and is the main
              source of CTNNB1 mutations. Flood of insertions/deletions
              (indels) are identified in very highly expressed hepato-specific
              genes, likely resulting from replication-transcription
              collisions. Reconstruction of sub-clonal architecture reveals
              mutational signature evolution during tumor development
              exemplified by the vanishing of aflatoxin B1 signature in African
              migrants. Finally, chromosome duplications occur late and may
              represent rate-limiting events in tumorigenesis. These findings

              we present Octopus, a variant caller that uses a polymorphic
              Bayesian genotyping model capable of modeling sequencing data
              from a range of experimental designs within a unified
              haplotype-aware framework. Octopus combines sequencing reads and
              prior information to phase-called genotypes of arbitrary ploidy,

              accurately calls germline variants in individuals, including
              single nucleotide variants, indels and small complex replacements

              selection. The rate of de novo mutations is therefore of major
              importance to evolution. Here we conduct a study of genome-wide
              mutation rates by sequencing the entire genomes of 78 Icelandic
              parent-offspring trios at high coverage. We show that in our
              samples, with an average father's age of 29.7, the average de
              novo mutation rate is 1.20 $\times$ 10(-8) per nucleotide per
              generation. Most notably, the diversity in mutation rate of
              single nucleotide polymorphisms is dominated by the age of the
              father at conception of the child. The effect is an increase of
              about two mutations per year. An exponential model estimates
              paternal mutations doubling every 16.5 years. After accounting
              for random Poisson variation, father's age is estimated to
              explain nearly all of the remaining variation in the de novo
              mutation counts. These observations shed light on the importance
              of the father's age on the risk of diseases such as schizophrenia

              and error-prone: rates of chromosome crossover vary among
              gametes, between the sexes, and among humans of the same sex, and
              chromosome missegregation leads to abnormal chromosome numbers
              (aneuploidy)1-8. To study diverse meiotic outcomes and how they
              covary across chromosomes, gametes and humans, we developed
              Sperm-seq, a way of simultaneously analysing the genomes of
              thousands of individual sperm. Here we analyse the genomes of
              31,228 human gametes from 20 sperm donors, identifying 813,122
              crossovers and 787 aneuploid chromosomes. Sperm donors had
              aneuploidy rates ranging from 0.01 to 0.05 aneuploidies per
              gamete; crossovers partially protected chromosomes from
              nondisjunction at the meiosis I cell division. Some chromosomes
              and donors underwent more-frequent nondisjunction during meiosis
              I, and others showed more meiosis II segregation failures. Sperm
              genomes also manifested many genomic anomalies that could not be
              explained by simple nondisjunction. Diverse recombination
              phenotypes-from crossover rates to crossover location and
              separation, a measure of crossover interference-covaried strongly
              across individuals and cells. Our results can be incorporated
              with earlier observations into a unified model in which a core
              mechanism, the variable physical compaction of meiotic
              chromosomes, generates interindividual and cell-to-cell variation
              in diverse meiotic phenotypes.",
