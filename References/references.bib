  abstract = "Methylation of cytosine residues in DNA provides a mechanism of
              gene control. There are two classes of methyltransferase in
              Arabidopsis; one has a carboxy-terminal methyltransferase domain
              fused to an amino-terminal regulatory domain and is similar to
              mammalian methyltransferases. The second class apparently lacks
              an amino-terminal domain and is less well conserved.
              Methylcytosine can occur at any cytosine residue, but it is
              likely that clonal transmission of methylation patterns only
              occurs for cytosines in strand-symmetrical sequences CpG and
              CpNpG. In plants, as in mammals, DNA methylation has dual roles
              in defense against invading DNA and transposable elements and in
              gene regulation. Although originally reported as having no
              phenotypic consequence, reduced DNA methylation disrupts normal
              plant development.",

              methylated base emerged across all domains of life and revealed a

              remove DNA methylation and have access to a staggering and

              well-represented animal phyla, and among plants, animals and
              fungi. The time estimate for the chordate-arthropod divergence,
              using 50 genes, is 993 +/- 46 Ma. Nematodes were found to have
              diverged from the lineage leading to arthropods and chordates at
              1177 +/- 79 Ma. Phylogenetic analyses also show that a basal
              position of nematodes has strong support (p > 99\%) and is not
              the result of rate biases. The three-way split (relationships
              unresolved) of plants, animals and fungi was estimated at 1576

              Cnidaria, Ctenophora) diverged between about 1200-1500 Ma. This
              suggests that at least six animal phyla originated deep in the

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Cancer genomes are peppered with somatic mutations
              imprinted by different mutational processes. The mutational
              pattern of a cancer genome can be used to identify and understand
              the etiology of the underlying mutational processes. A plethora
              of prior research has focused on examining mutational signatures
              and mutational patterns from single base substitutions and their
              immediate sequencing context. We recently demonstrated that
              further classification of small mutational events (including
              substitutions, insertions, deletions, and doublet substitutions)
              can be used to provide a deeper understanding of the mutational
              processes that have molded a cancer genome. However, there has
              been no standard tool that allows fast, accurate, and
              comprehensive classification for all types of small mutational
              events. RESULTS: Here, we present SigProfilerMatrixGenerator, a
              computational tool designed for optimized exploration and
              visualization of mutational patterns for all types of small
              mutational events. SigProfilerMatrixGenerator is written in
              Python with an R wrapper package provided for users that prefer
              working in an R environment. SigProfilerMatrixGenerator produces
              fourteen distinct matrices by considering transcriptional strand
              bias of individual events and by incorporating distinct
              classifications for single base substitutions, doublet base
              substitutions, and small insertions and deletions. While the tool
              provides a comprehensive classification of mutations,
              SigProfilerMatrixGenerator is also faster and more memory
              efficient than existing tools that generate only a single matrix.
              CONCLUSIONS: SigProfilerMatrixGenerator provides a standardized
              method for classifying small mutational events that is both
              efficient and scalable to large datasets. In addition to
              extending the classification of single base substitutions, the
              tool is the first to provide support for classifying doublet base
              substitutions and small insertions and deletions.

              However, haplotype divergence in regions of high heterozygosity

              there is a need for a highly accurate set of genotypes across a
              genome that can be used as a benchmark. Here we present methods

              and three variant callers. We identify regions for which no

  abstract = "Motivation. The third generation sequencing (3GS) technology
              generates long sequences of thousands of bases. However, its
              current error rates are estimated in the range of 15-40\%,
              significantly higher than those of the prevalent next generation
              sequencing (NGS) technologies (less than 1\%). Fundamental
              bioinformatics tasks such as de novo genome assembly and variant
              calling require high-quality sequences that need to be extracted
              from these long but erroneous 3GS sequences. Results. We describe
              a versatile and efficient linear complexity consensus algorithm
              Sparc to facilitate de novo genome assembly. Sparc builds a
              sparse k-mer graph using a collection of sequences from a
              targeted genomic region. The heaviest path which approximates the
              most likely genome sequence is searched through a
              sparsity-induced reweighted graph as the consensus sequence.
              Sparc supports using NGS and 3GS data together, which leads to
              significant improvements in both cost efficiency and
              computational efficiency. Experiments with Sparc show that our
              algorithm can efficiently provide high-quality consensus
              sequences using both PacBio and Oxford Nanopore sequencing
              technologies. With only 30$\times$ PacBio data, Sparc can reach a
              consensus with error rate <0.5\%. With the more challenging
              Oxford Nanopore data, Sparc can also achieve similar error rate
              when combined with NGS data. Compared with the existing
              approaches, Sparc calculates the consensus with higher accuracy,
              and uses approximately 80\% less memory and time. Availability.

              this issue, the international Genome 10K (G10K) consortium5,6 has
              worked over a five-year period to evaluate and develop

              generating assemblies for 16 species that represent six major
              vertebrate lineages. We confirm that long-read sequencing
              technologies are essential for maximizing genome quality, and
              that unresolved complex repeats and haplotype heterozygosity are
              major sources of assembly error when not handled correctly. Our
              assemblies correct substantial errors, add missing sequence in
              some of the best historical reference genomes, and reveal
              biological discoveries. These include the identification of many
              false gene duplications, increases in gene sizes, chromosome
              rearrangements that are specific to lineages, a repeated

  abstract  = "A major constraint on the evolution of large body sizes in
               animals is an increased risk of developing cancer. There is no
               correlation, however, between body size and cancer risk. This
               lack of correlation is often referred to as 'Peto's Paradox'.
               Here, we show that the elephant genome encodes 20 copies of the
               tumor suppressor gene TP53 and that the increase in TP53 copy
               number occurred coincident with the evolution of large body
               sizes, the evolution of extreme sensitivity to genotoxic stress,
               and a hyperactive TP53 signaling pathway in the elephant
               (Proboscidean) lineage. Furthermore, we show that several of the
               TP53 retrogenes (TP53RTGs) are transcribed and likely
               translated. While TP53RTGs do not appear to directly function as
               transcription factors, they do contribute to the enhanced
               sensitivity of elephant cells to DNA damage and the induction of
               apoptosis by regulating activity of the TP53 signaling pathway.
               These results suggest that an increase in the copy number of
               TP53 may have played a direct role in the evolution of very
               large body sizes and the resolution of Peto's paradox in

              OBJECTIVE: To identify mechanisms for cancer resistance in
              elephants and compare cellular response to DNA damage among
              elephants, healthy human controls, and cancer-prone patients with
              Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A
              comprehensive survey of necropsy data was performed across 36
              mammalian species to validate cancer resistance in large and
              long-lived organisms, including elephants (n = 644). The African
              and Asian elephant genomes were analyzed for potential mechanisms
              of cancer resistance. Peripheral blood lymphocytes from
              elephants, healthy human controls, and patients with LFS were
              tested in vitro in the laboratory for DNA damage response. The
              study included African and Asian elephants (n = 8), patients with
              LFS (n = 10), and age-matched human controls (n = 11). Human
              samples were collected at the University of Utah between June
              2014 and July 2015. EXPOSURES: Ionizing radiation and
              doxorubicin. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Cancer mortality across
              species was calculated and compared by body size and life span.
              The elephant genome was investigated for alterations in
              cancer-related genes. DNA repair and apoptosis were compared in
              elephant vs human peripheral blood lymphocytes. RESULTS: Across
              mammals, cancer mortality did not increase with body size and/or
              maximum life span (eg, for rock hyrax, 1\% [95\% CI, 0\%-5\%];
              African wild dog, 8\% [95\% CI, 0\%-16\%]; lion, 2\% [95\% CI,
              0\%-7\%]). Despite their large body size and long life span,
              elephants remain cancer resistant, with an estimated cancer
              mortality of 4.81\% (95\% CI, 3.14\%-6.49\%), compared with
              humans, who have 11\% to 25\% cancer mortality. While humans have
              1 copy (2 alleles) of TP53, African elephants have at least 20
              copies (40 alleles), including 19 retrogenes (38 alleles) with
              evidence of transcriptional activity measured by reverse
              transcription polymerase chain reaction. In response to DNA
              damage, elephant lymphocytes underwent p53-mediated apoptosis at
              higher rates than human lymphocytes proportional to TP53 status
              (ionizing radiation exposure: patients with LFS, 2.71\% [95\% CI,
              1.93\%-3.48\%] vs human controls, 7.17\% [95\% CI, 5.91\%-8.44\%]
              vs elephants, 14.64\% [95\% CI, 10.91\%-18.37\%]; P < .001;
              doxorubicin exposure: human controls, 8.10\% [95\% CI,
              6.55\%-9.66\%] vs elephants, 24.77\% [95\% CI, 23.0\%-26.53\%]; P
              < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Compared with other mammalian
              species, elephants appeared to have a lower-than-expected rate of
              cancer, potentially related to multiple copies of TP53. Compared
              with human cells, elephant cells demonstrated increased apoptotic
              response following DNA damage. These findings, if replicated,
              could represent an evolutionary-based approach for understanding
              mechanisms related to cancer suppression.",

              adult zoo mammals (110,148 individuals, 191 species) and map

              mortality across major mammalian orders. We show that the
              phylogenetic distribution of cancer mortality is associated with
              diet, with carnivorous mammals (especially mammal-consuming ones)
              facing the highest cancer-related mortality. Moreover, we provide
              unequivocal evidence for the body size and longevity components
              of Peto's paradox by showing that cancer mortality risk is
              largely independent of both body mass and adult life expectancy
              across species. These results highlight the key role of
              life-history evolution in shaping cancer resistance and provide

              algorithms, our understanding of genetic variation and somatic
              mutations is far from complete. METHODS: In the present study, we
              performed whole-genome sequencing using long-read sequencing
              technology (Oxford Nanopore) for 11 Japanese liver cancers and
              matched normal samples which were previously sequenced for the
              International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC). We constructed an
              analysis pipeline for the long-read data and identified germline
              and somatic structural variations (SVs). RESULTS: In polymorphic
              germline SVs, our analysis identified 8004 insertions, 6389
              deletions, 27 inversions, and 32 intra-chromosomal
              translocations. By comparing to the chimpanzee genome, we
              correctly inferred events that caused insertions and deletions
              and found that most insertions were caused by transposons and Alu
              is the most predominant source, while other types of insertions,
              such as tandem duplications and processed pseudogenes, are rare.
              We inferred mechanisms of deletion generations and found that
              most non-allelic homolog recombination (NAHR) events were caused
              by recombination errors in SINEs. Analysis of somatic mutations
              in liver cancers showed that long reads could detect larger
              numbers of SVs than a previous short-read study and that
              mechanisms of cancer SV generation were different from that of

              than half of the validated CNVs that it identifies are not
              detected by split-read or read-pair. By genotyping CNVs in the
              CEPH, Yoruba, and Chinese-Japanese populations, we estimated that
              at least 11\% of all CNV loci involve complex, multi-allelic
              events, a considerably higher estimate than reported earlier.
              Moreover, among these events, we observed cases with allele
              distribution strongly deviating from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium,
              possibly implying selection on certain complex loci. Finally, by
              combining discovery and genotyping, we identified six potential
              de novo CNVs in two family trios.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Pediatric disorders include a range of highly
              penetrant, genetically heterogeneous conditions amenable to
              genomewide diagnostic approaches. Finding a molecular diagnosis
              is challenging but can have profound lifelong benefits. METHODS:
              We conducted a large-scale sequencing study involving more than
              13,500 families with probands with severe, probably monogenic,
              difficult-to-diagnose developmental disorders from 24 regional
              genetics services in the United Kingdom and Ireland. Standardized
              phenotypic data were collected, and exome sequencing and
              microarray analyses were performed to investigate novel genetic
              causes. We developed an iterative variant analysis pipeline and
              reported candidate variants to clinical teams for validation and
              diagnostic interpretation to inform communication with families.
              Multiple regression analyses were performed to evaluate factors
              affecting the probability of diagnosis. RESULTS: A total of
              13,449 probands were included in the analyses. On average, we
              reported 1.0 candidate variant per parent-offspring trio and 2.5
              variants per singleton proband. Using clinical and computational
              approaches to variant classification, we made a diagnosis in
              approximately 41\% of probands (5502 of 13,449). Of 3599 probands
              in trios who received a diagnosis by clinical assertion,
              approximately 76\% had a pathogenic de novo variant. Another 22\%
              of probands (2997 of 13,449) had variants of uncertain
              significance in genes that were strongly linked to monogenic
              developmental disorders. Recruitment in a parent-offspring trio
              had the largest effect on the probability of diagnosis (odds
              ratio, 4.70; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 4.16 to 5.31).
              Probands were less likely to receive a diagnosis if they were
              born extremely prematurely (i.e., 22 to 27 weeks' gestation; odds
              ratio, 0.39; 95\% CI, 0.22 to 0.68), had in utero exposure to
              antiepileptic medications (odds ratio, 0.44; 95\% CI, 0.29 to
              0.67), had mothers with diabetes (odds ratio, 0.52; 95\% CI, 0.41
              to 0.67), or were of African ancestry (odds ratio, 0.51; 95\% CI,
              0.31 to 0.78). CONCLUSIONS: Among probands with severe, probably
              monogenic, difficult-to-diagnose developmental disorders,
              multimodal analysis of genomewide data had good diagnostic power,
              even after previous attempts at diagnosis. (Funded by the Health

              fingerprinting scheme for a particular project.",

              individuals when conventional testing approaches have been

              belonging to each copy, are crucial for downstream analyses in
              population genetics. Currently, statistical approaches, which are
              oblivious to direct read information, constitute the
              state-of-the-art. Haplotype assembly, which addresses phasing
              directly from sequencing reads, suffers from the fact that
              sequencing reads of the current generation are too short to serve
              the purposes of genome-wide phasing. While future-technology
              sequencing reads will contain sufficient amounts of SNPs per read

              coverage up to 20$\times$, and that 15$\times$ are generally
              enough for reliably phasing long reads, even at significantly
              elevated sequencing error rates. We also find that the switch and

              Recent genome assembly projects have relied on a combination of
              noisy long-read sequencing and accurate short-read sequencing,
              with the former offering greater assembly continuity and the
              latter providing higher consensus accuracy. The recently
              introduced Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) HiFi sequencing
              technology bridges this divide by delivering long reads (>10 kbp)
              with high per-base accuracy (>99.9\%). Here we present HiCanu, a
              modification of the Canu assembler designed to leverage the full
              potential of HiFi reads via homopolymer compression,
              overlap-based error correction, and aggressive false overlap
              filtering. We benchmark HiCanu with a focus on the recovery of
              haplotype diversity, major histocompatibility complex (MHC)
              variants, satellite DNAs, and segmental duplications. For diploid
              human genomes sequenced to 30$\times$ HiFi coverage, HiCanu
              achieved superior accuracy and allele recovery compared to the
              current state of the art. On the effectively haploid CHM13 human
              cell line, HiCanu achieved an NG50 contig size of 77 Mbp with a
              per-base consensus accuracy of 99.999\% (QV50), surpassing recent

              Technologies (ONT) reads in terms of both accuracy and
              continuity. This HiCanu assembly correctly resolves 337 out of
              341 validation BACs sampled from known segmental duplications and
              provides the first preliminary assemblies of nine complete human

              the most challenging regions of the genome, these results

              mutations, many of which are associated with diseases. Moreover,
              PacBio transcriptome sequencing is advantageous for the
              identification of gene isoforms and facilitates reliable
              discoveries of novel genes and novel isoforms of annotated genes,

              revolutionized genomic and genetic research. The pace of change
              in this area is rapid with three major new sequencing platforms
              having been released in 2011: Ion Torrent's PGM, Pacific
              Biosciences' RS and the Illumina MiSeq. Here we compare the
              results obtained with those platforms to the performance of the
              Illumina HiSeq, the current market leader. In order to compare
              these platforms, and get sufficient coverage depth to allow
              meaningful analysis, we have sequenced a set of 4 microbial
              genomes with mean GC content ranging from 19.3 to 67.7\%.
              Together, these represent a comprehensive range of genome
              content. Here we report our analysis of that sequence data in
              terms of coverage distribution, bias, GC distribution, variant
              detection and accuracy. RESULTS: Sequence generated by Ion
              Torrent, MiSeq and Pacific Biosciences technologies displays near
              perfect coverage behaviour on GC-rich, neutral and moderately
              AT-rich genomes, but a profound bias was observed upon sequencing
              the extremely AT-rich genome of Plasmodium falciparum on the PGM,
              resulting in no coverage for approximately 30\% of the genome. We
              analysed the ability to call variants from each platform and
              found that we could call slightly more variants from Ion Torrent
              data compared to MiSeq data, but at the expense of a higher false
              positive rate. Variant calling from Pacific Biosciences data was
              possible but higher coverage depth was required. Context specific
              errors were observed in both PGM and MiSeq data, but not in that
              from the Pacific Biosciences platform. CONCLUSIONS: All three
              fast turnaround sequencers evaluated here were able to generate
              usable sequence. However there are key differences between the
              quality of that data and the applications it will support.",

              discoveries of important biological or medical benefit.
              Sequencing projects have traditionally used long (400-800 base
              pair) reads, but the existence of reference sequences for the
              human and many other genomes makes it possible to develop new,
              fast approaches to re-sequencing, whereby shorter reads are
              compared to a reference to identify intraspecies genetic
              variation. Here we report an approach that generates several
              billion bases of accurate nucleotide sequence per experiment at
              low cost. Single molecules of DNA are attached to a flat surface,
              amplified in situ and used as templates for synthetic sequencing
              with fluorescent reversible terminator deoxyribonucleotides.
              Images of the surface are analysed to generate high-quality
              sequence. We demonstrate application of this approach to human
              genome sequencing on flow-sorted X chromosomes and then scale the
              approach to determine the genome sequence of a male Yoruba from
              Ibadan, Nigeria. We build an accurate consensus sequence from
              >30x average depth of paired 35-base reads. We characterize four
              million single-nucleotide polymorphisms and four hundred thousand
              structural variants, many of which were previously unknown. Our
              approach is effective for accurate, rapid and economical
              whole-genome re-sequencing and many other biomedical
              applications.",

              E. coli carrying the pks-island. Examination of publicly

              suggested, the etiology and pathogenesis of the majority of
              cholangiocarcinomas remain unclear. Recently, a high incidence of
              early-onset cholangiocarcinoma was reported among the workers of
              a printing company in Osaka, Japan. These workers underwent high
              exposure to organic solvents, mainly haloalkanes such as
              1,2-dichloropropane (1,2-DCP) and/or dichloromethane. We
              performed whole-exome analysis on four cases of
              cholangiocarcinoma among the printing workers. An average of 44.8
              somatic mutations was detected per Mb in the genome of the
              printing workers' cholangiocarcinoma tissues, approximately
              30-fold higher than that found in control common
              cholangiocarcinoma tissues. Furthermore, C:G-to-T:A transitions

              characteristic pattern of somatic mutations, called a mutational
              signature. Despite widespread use of cisplatin in cancer
              treatment and its role in contributing to secondary malignancies,
              its mutational signature has not been delineated. We hypothesize
              that cisplatin's mutational signature can serve as a biomarker to
              identify cisplatin mutagenesis in suspected secondary
              malignancies. Knowledge of which tissues are at risk of
              developing cisplatin-induced secondary malignancies could lead to
              guidelines for noninvasive monitoring for secondary malignancies
              after cisplatin chemotherapy. We performed whole genome
              sequencing of 10 independent clones of cisplatin-exposed MCF-10A
              and HepG2 cells and delineated the patterns of single and
              dinucleotide mutations in terms of flanking sequence,
              transcription strand bias, and other characteristics. We used the
              mSigAct signature presence test and nonnegative matrix
              factorization to search for cisplatin mutagenesis in
              hepatocellular carcinomas and esophageal adenocarcinomas. All
              clones showed highly consistent patterns of single and
              dinucleotide substitutions. The proportion of dinucleotide
              substitutions was high: 8.1\% of single nucleotide substitutions
              were part of dinucleotide substitutions, presumably due to
              cisplatin's propensity to form intra- and interstrand crosslinks
              between purine bases in DNA. We identified likely cisplatin
              exposure in nine hepatocellular carcinomas and three esophageal
              adenocarcinomas. All hepatocellular carcinomas for which clinical
              data were available and all esophageal cancers indeed had
              histories of cisplatin treatment. We experimentally delineated
              the single and dinucleotide mutational signature of cisplatin.
              This signature enabled us to detect previous cisplatin exposure

              G:C$\rightarrow$T:A, and viral processes synergize to accelerate

              early-onset evidence predicting disease development, highly
              accurate duplex sequencing was used to monitor acquisition of
              high-resolution mutational spectra (HRMS) during the process of
              hepatocarcinogenesis. Four-day-old male mice were treated with
              AFB1 using a regimen that induced HCC within 72 wk. For analysis,
              livers were separated into tumor and adjacent cellular fractions.
              HRMS of cells surrounding the tumors revealed predominantly
              G:C$\rightarrow$T:A mutations characteristic of AFB1 exposure.
              Importantly, 25\% of all mutations were G$\rightarrow$T in one
              trinucleotide context (CGC; the underlined G is the position of
              the mutation), which is also a hotspot mutation in human liver
              tumors whose incidence correlates with AFB1 exposure. The
              technology proved sufficiently sensitive that the same
              distinctive spectrum was detected as early as 10 wk after dosing,
              well before evidence of neoplasia. Additionally, analysis of
              tumor tissue revealed a more complex pattern than observed in
              surrounding hepatocytes; tumor HRMS were a composite of the 10-wk
              spectrum and a more heterogeneous set of mutations that emerged
              during tumor outgrowth. We propose that the 10-wk HRMS reflects a
              short-term mutational response to AFB1, and, as such, is an early
              detection metric for AFB1-induced liver cancer in this mouse

              sequencing has revealed that many cancers, including breast
              cancer, have somatic mutation spectra dominated by C-to-T
              transitions. Most of these mutations occur at hydrolytically
              disfavoured non-methylated cytosines throughout the genome, and
              are sometimes clustered. Here we show that the DNA cytosine
              deaminase APOBEC3B is a probable source of these mutations.
              APOBEC3B messenger RNA is upregulated in most primary breast
              tumours and breast cancer cell lines. Tumours that express high
              levels of APOBEC3B have twice as many mutations as those that
              express low levels and are more likely to have mutations in TP53.
              Endogenous APOBEC3B protein is predominantly nuclear and the only
              detectable source of DNA C-to-U editing activity in breast cancer
              cell-line extracts. Knockdown experiments show that endogenous
              APOBEC3B correlates with increased levels of genomic uracil,
              increased mutation frequencies, and C-to-T transitions.
              Furthermore, induced APOBEC3B overexpression causes cell cycle
              deviations, cell death, DNA fragmentation, $\gamma$-H2AX
              accumulation and C-to-T mutations. Our data suggest a model in
              which APOBEC3B-catalysed deamination provides a chronic source of
              DNA damage in breast cancers that could select TP53 inactivation

              Different mutational processes may contribute to the mutations
              accumulated in a cell, with each imprinting a mutational
              signature on the cell's genome. Some processes generate mutations
              throughout life at a constant rate in all individuals, and the
              number of mutations in a cell attributable to these processes
              will be proportional to the chronological age of the person.
              Using mutations from 10,250 cancer genomes across 36 cancer
              types, we investigated clock-like mutational processes that have
              been operating in normal human cells. Two mutational signatures
              show clock-like properties. Both exhibit different mutation rates
              in different tissues. However, their mutation rates are not
              correlated, indicating that the underlying processes are subject
              to different biological influences. For one signature, the rate
              of cell division may influence its mutation rate. This study
              provides the first survey of clock-like mutational processes

  abstract = "Reduction-oxidation (redox) reactions, in which electrons move
              from a donor to an acceptor, are the functional heart of
              photosynthesis. It is not surprising therefore that reactive
              oxygen species (ROS) are generated in abundance by
              photosynthesis, providing a plethora of redox signals as well as
              functioning as essential regulators of energy and metabolic
              fluxes. Chloroplasts are equipped with an elaborate and
              multifaceted protective network that allows photosynthesis to
              function with high productivity even in resource-limited natural
              environments. This includes numerous antioxidants with
              overlapping functions that provide enormous flexibility in redox
              control. ROS are an integral part of the repertoire of
              chloroplast signals that are transferred to the nucleus to convey
              essential information concerning redox pressure within the
              electron transport chain. Current evidence suggests that there is
              specificity in the gene-expression profiles triggered by the
              different ROS signals, so that singlet oxygen triggers programs
              related to over excitation of photosystem (PS) II while
              superoxide and hydrogen peroxide promote the expression of other
              suites of genes that may serve to alleviate electron pressure on
              the reducing side of PSI. Not all chloroplasts are equal in their
              signaling functions, with some sub-populations appearing to have
              better contacts/access to the nucleus than others to promote
              genetic and epigenetic responses. While the concept that
              light-induced increases in ROS result in damage to PSII and
              photoinhibition is embedded in the photosynthesis literature,
              there is little consensus concerning the extent to which such
              oxidative damage happens in nature. Slowly reversible decreases
              in photosynthetic capacity are not necessarily the result of
              light-induced damage to PSII reaction centers.",

  author   = "Rolff, Jens and Johnston, Paul R and Reynolds, Stuart",
  abstract = "The majority of described hexapod species are holometabolous
              insects, undergoing an extreme form of metamorphosis with an
              intercalated pupal stage between the larva and adult, in which
              organs and tissues are extensively remodelled and in some cases
              completely rebuilt. Here, we review how and why this
              developmental strategy has evolved. While there are many theories
              explaining the evolution of metamorphosis, many of which fit
              under the hypothesis of decoupling of life stages, there are few
              clear adaptive hypotheses on why complete metamorphosis evolved.
              We propose that the main adaptive benefit of complete
              metamorphosis is decoupling between growth and differentiation.
              This facilitates the exploitation of ephemeral resources and
              enhances the probability of the metamorphic transition escaping
              developmental size thresholds. The evolution of complete
              metamorphosis comes at the cost of exposure to predators,
              parasites and pathogens during pupal life and requires specific
              adaptations of the immune system at this time. Moreover,
              metamorphosis poses a challenge for the maintenance of symbionts
              and the gut microbiota, although it may also offer the benefit of
              allowing an extensive change in microbiota between the larval and
              adult stages. The regulation of metamorphosis by two main
              players, ecdysone and juvenile hormone, and the related
              signalling cascades are now relatively well understood. The
              mechanics of metamorphosis have recently been studied in detail
              because of the advent of micro-CT and research into the role of
              cell death in remodelling tissues and organs. We support the
              argument that the adult stage must necessarily have preceded the
              larval form of the insect. We do not resolve the still
              contentious question of whether the larva of insects in general
              originated through the modification of existing preadult forms or
              through heterochrony as a modified embryonic stage (pronymph),
              nor whether the holometabolous pupa arose as a modified
              hemimetabolous final stage larva. This article is part of the

              melanogaster, a classical genetic and molecular model system, but
              also in numerous other insects. However, these two extensive
              bodies of work remain poorly integrated to date. Studies in
              Drosophila often explore genetic, developmental, physiological,
              and nutrition-related aspects of aging in the lab, while studies
              in other insects often explore ecological, social, and somatic
              aspects of aging in both lab and natural populations. Alongside
              exciting genomic and molecular research advances in aging in
              Drosophila, many new studies have also been published on aging in
              various other insects, including studies on aging in natural
              populations of diverse species. However, no broad synthesis of
              these largely separate bodies of work has been attempted. In this
              review, we endeavor to synthesize these two semi-independent
              literatures to facilitate collaboration and foster the exchange
              of ideas and research tools. While lab studies of Drosophila have

              diversity of aging patterns among insects, especially in the
              context of their rich ecology, remains vastlyunderstudied.
              Coupled with field studies and novel, more easily applicable

              long-standing hypotheses about the evolution of somatic mutation
              rates and their role in cancer and ageing. Here we performed
              whole-genome sequencing of 208 intestinal crypts from 56
              individuals to study the landscape of somatic mutation across 16
              mammalian species. We found that somatic mutagenesis was
              dominated by seemingly endogenous mutational processes in all
              species, including 5-methylcytosine deamination and oxidative
              damage. With some differences, mutational signatures in other
              species resembled those described in humans8, although the
              relative contribution of each signature varied across species.
              Notably, the somatic mutation rate per year varied greatly across
              species and exhibited a strong inverse relationship with species
              lifespan, with no other life-history trait studied showing a
              comparable association. Despite widely different life histories
              among the species we examined-including variation of around
              30-fold in lifespan and around 40,000-fold in body mass-the
              somatic mutation burden at the end of lifespan varied only by a
              factor of around 3. These data unveil common mutational processes
              across mammals, and suggest that somatic mutation rates are

  author   = "Boulton, A and Myers, R S and Redfield, R J",
  abstract = "Studies of meiotic recombination have revealed an evolutionary
              paradox. Molecular and genetic analysis has shown that crossing
              over initiates at specific sites called hotspots, by a
              recombinational-repair mechanism in which the initiating hotspot
              is replaced by a copy of its homolog. We have used computer
              simulations of large populations to show that this mechanism
              causes active hotspot alleles to be rapidly replaced by inactive
              alleles, which arise by rare mutation and increase by
              recombination-associated conversion. Additional simulations
              solidified the paradox by showing that the known benefits of
              recombination appear inadequate to maintain its mechanism.
              Neither the benefits of accurate segregation nor those of
              recombining flanking genes were sufficient to preserve active
              alleles in the face of conversion. A partial resolution to this
              paradox was obtained by introducing into the model an additional,
              nonmeiotic function for the sites that initiate recombination,
              consistent with the observed association of hotspots with
              functional sites in chromatin. Provided selection for this
              function was sufficiently strong, active hotspots were able to
              persist in spite of frequent conversion to inactive alleles.
              However, this explanation is unsatisfactory for two reasons.
              First, it is unlikely to apply to obligately sexual species,
              because observed crossover frequencies imply maintenance of many
              hotspots per genome, and the viability selection needed to
              preserve these would drive the species to extinction. Second, it
              fails to explain why such a genetically costly mechanism of
              recombination has been maintained over evolutionary time. Thus
              the paradox persists and is likely to be resolved only by
              significant changes to the commonly accepted mechanism of
              crossing over.",

              cross-over hotspots. However, very few of these putative hotspots
              have been directly analyzed for cross-over activity. We now
              describe a search for very active hotspots, by using extreme
              breakdown of marker association as a guide for high-resolution
              sperm cross-over analysis. This strategy has led to the isolation
              of the most active cross-over hotspots yet described. Their
              morphology, sequence attributes, and cross-over processes are
              very similar to those seen at less active hotspots, but their
              activity in sperm is poorly predicted from population diversity
              information. Several of these hotspots showed evidence for biased
              gene conversion accompanying cross-over, in some cases associated
              with variation between men in cross-over activity and with two
              hotspots showing complete presence/absence polymorphism in
              different men. Hotspot polymorphism is very common at less active
              hotspots but curiously was not seen at any of the most active
              hotspots. This contrasts with the prediction that extreme
              hotspots should be the most vulnerable to attenuation by meiotic
              drive in favor of mutations that suppress recombination and
              should therefore show rapid rate evolution and thus variation in
              activity between men. Finally, these very intense hotspots
              provide a valuable resource for dissecting meiotic recombination
              processes and pathways in humans.",

              disequilibrium (LD) patterns that capture historical
              recombination events. The use of these maps has been demonstrated
              by the identification of recombination hotspots and associated
              motifs, and the discovery that the PRDM9 gene affects the
              proportion of recombinations occurring at hotspots. However,
              these maps provide no information about individual or sex
              differences. Moreover, locus-specific demographic factors like
              natural selection can bias LD-based estimates of recombination
              rate. Existing genetic maps based on family data avoid these
              shortcomings, but their resolution is limited by relatively few
              meioses and a low density of markers. Here we used genome-wide
              SNP data from 15,257 parent-offspring pairs to construct the
              first recombination maps based on directly observed
              recombinations with a resolution that is effective down to 10
              kilobases (kb). Comparing male and female maps reveals that about
              15\% of hotspots in one sex are specific to that sex. Although
              male recombinations result in more shuffling of exons within
              genes, female recombinations generate more new combinations of
              nearby genes. We discover novel associations between

              observed frequency of mutation at sites containing
              5-methylcytosine and emphasize the importance of hydrolytic

              aristolochic acid reacts with DNA to form aristolactam (AL)-DNA

              they serve as a sensitive and specific biomarker of exposure, and
              are found also in the urothelium, where they give rise to a
              unique mutational signature in the TP53 tumor-suppressor gene.
              Using AL-DNA adducts and TP53 mutation spectra as biomarkers, we
              conducted a molecular epidemiologic study of UUC in Taiwan, where
              the incidence of UUC is the highest reported anywhere in the

              contribute to the evolution of treatment-resistant tumour cells.
              The stable diploid genome of the chicken DT40 lymphoblast cell
              line, an established DNA repair model system, is well suited to
              accurately assay genomic mutations. RESULTS: We use whole genome
              sequencing of multiple DT40 clones to determine the mutagenic
              effect of eight common cytotoxics used for the treatment of
              millions of patients worldwide. We determine the spontaneous
              mutagenesis rate at 2.3 $\times$ 10(-10) per base per cell
              division and find that cisplatin, cyclophosphamide and etoposide
              induce extra base substitutions with distinct spectra. After four
              cycles of exposure, cisplatin induces 0.8 mutations per Mb,
              equivalent to the median mutational burden in common leukaemias.
              Cisplatin-induced mutations, including short insertions and
              deletions, are mainly located at sites of putative intrastrand
              crosslinks. We find two of the newly defined cisplatin-specific
              mutation types as causes of the reversion of BRCA2 mutations in
              emerging cisplatin-resistant tumours or cell clones. Gemcitabine,
              5-fluorouracil, hydroxyurea, doxorubicin and paclitaxel have no
              measurable mutagenic effect. The cisplatin-induced mutation

              attributed to smoking and other sources of guanine-directed base
              damage. CONCLUSION: This study provides support for the use of
              cell line mutagenesis assays to validate or predict the mutagenic
              effect of environmental and iatrogenic exposures. Our results

              generations. Telomere erosion led to complex chromosomal

              completed by simultaneously acquired, localized clusters of
              breakpoints. Aflatoxin B1 induced substitutions of guanines in a

              other, to the - strand of DNA, a complex pattern of DNA strand
              displacement ensues that generates 10(9) or more copies of each
              circle in 90 minutes, enabling detection of point mutations in
              human genomic DNA. Using a single primer, RCA generates hundreds
              of tandemly linked copies of a covalently closed circle in a few
              minutes. If matrix-associated, the DNA product remains bound at
              the site of synthesis, where it may be tagged, condensed and
              imaged as a point light source. Linear oligonucleotide probes
              bound covalently on a glass surface can generate RCA signals, the
              colour of which indicates the allele status of the target,
              depending on the outcome of specific, target-directed ligation
              events. As RCA permits millions of individual probe molecules to
              be counted and sorted using colour codes, it is particularly
              amenable for the analysis of rare somatic mutations. RCA also
              shows promise for the detection of padlock probes bound to
              single-copy genes in cytological preparations.",

              Deploying this framework to 9,873 cancers representing 33 human

              copy number signatures that explain the copy number patterns of

              hepatic inflammation to cirrhosis, liver failure or

              during the progression to chronic liver disease and subsequent
              malignant transformation. Here, by sequencing whole genomes of
              482 microdissections of 100-500 hepatocytes from 5 normal and 9
              cirrhotic livers, we show that cirrhotic liver has a higher
              mutational burden than normal liver. Although rare in normal
              hepatocytes, structural variants, including chromothripsis, were
              prominent in cirrhosis. Driver mutations, such as point mutations
              and structural variants, affected 1-5\% of clones. Clonal

              clones sequestered by the bands of fibrosis that surround
              regenerative nodules. Some mutational signatures were universal
              and equally active in both non-malignant hepatocytes and HCCs;
              some were substantially more active in HCCs than chronic liver
              disease; and others-arising from exogenous exposures-were present
              in a subset of patients. The activity of exogenous signatures
              between adjacent cirrhotic nodules varied by up to tenfold within
              each patient, as a result of clone-specific and
              microenvironmental forces. Synchronous HCCs exhibited the same
              mutational signatures as background cirrhotic liver, but with
              higher burden. Somatic mutations chronicle the exposures,
              toxicity, regeneration and clonal structure of liver tissue as it
              progresses from health to disease.",

              repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) frequently correlates
              with increased junctional microhomology. However, alt-EJ also
              produces junctions without microhomology (apparent blunt joins),
              and the exact role of microhomology in both alt-EJ and classical
              non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) remains unclear. To better
              understand the degree to which alt-EJ depends on annealing at
              pre-existing microhomologies, we examined inaccurate repair of an
              I-SceI DSB lacking nearby microhomologies of greater than four
              nucleotides in Drosophila. Lig4 deficiency affected neither
              frequency nor length of junctional microhomology, but
              significantly increased insertion frequency. Many insertions
              appeared to be templated. Based on sequence analysis of repair
              junctions, we propose a model of synthesis-dependent
              microhomology-mediated end joining (SD-MMEJ), in which de novo
              synthesis by an accurate non-processive DNA polymerase creates
              microhomology. Repair junctions with apparent blunt joins,
              junctional microhomologies and short indels (deletion with
              insertion) are often considered to reflect different repair
              mechanisms. However, a majority of each type had structures
              consistent with the predictions of our SD-MMEJ model. This
              suggests that a single underlying mechanism could be responsible
              for all three repair product types. Genetic analysis indicates
              that SD-MMEJ is Ku70, Lig4 and Rad51-independent but impaired in

Many de novo human genomes have been published in the last few years, leveraging a combination of inexpensive short-read and single-molecule long-read technologies. As long-read DNA sequencers become more prevalent, the computational burden of generating assemblies persists as a critical factor. The most common approach to long-read assembly, using an overlap-layout-consensus (OLC) paradigm, requires all-to-all read comparisons, which quadratically scales in computational complexity with the number of reads. We assert that recently achievements in sequencing technology (i.e. with accuracy ~99\% and read length ~10-15k) enables a fundamentally better strategy for OLC that is effectively linear rather than quadratic. Our genome assembly implementation, Peregrine uses sparse hierarchical minimizers (SHIMMER) to index reads thereby avoiding the need for an all-to-all read comparison step. Peregrine can assemble 30x human PacBio CCS read datasets in less than 30 CPU hours and around 100 wall-clock minutes to a high contiguity assembly (N50 > 20Mb). The continued advance of sequencing technologies coupled with the Peregrine assembler enables routine generation of human de novo assemblies. This will allow for population scale measurements of more comprehensive genomic variations -- beyond SNPs and small indels -- as well as novel applications requiring rapid access to de novo assemblies",

              assembly of nanopore reads alone yielded a contiguous assembly

              reads (N50 > 100 kb, read lengths up to 882 kb). Incorporating an
              additional 5$\times$ coverage of these ultra-long reads more than
              doubled the assembly contiguity (NG50 ∼6.4 Mb). The final
              assembled genome was 2,867 million bases in size, covering 85.8\%
              of the reference. Assembly accuracy, after incorporating
              complementary short-read sequencing data, exceeded 99.8\%.
              Ultra-long reads enabled assembly and phasing of the 4-Mb major

  abstract = "The human genome sequence remains incomplete, with
              multimegabase-sized gaps representing the endogenous centromeres
              and other heterochromatic regions. Available sequence-based
              studies within these sites in the genome have demonstrated a role
              in centromere function and chromosome pairing, necessary to
              ensure proper chromosome segregation during cell division. A
              common genomic feature of these regions is the enrichment of long
              arrays of near-identical tandem repeats, known as satellite DNAs,
              which offer a limited number of variant sites to differentiate
              individual repeat copies across millions of bases. This
              substantial sequence homogeneity challenges available assembly
              strategies and, as a result, centromeric regions are omitted from
              ongoing genomic studies. To address this problem, we utilize
              monomer sequence and ordering information obtained from
              whole-genome shotgun reads to model two haploid human satellite
              arrays on chromosomes X and Y, resulting in an initial
              characterization of 3.83 Mb of centromeric DNA within an
              individual genome. To further expand the utility of each
              centromeric reference sequence model, we evaluate sites within
              the arrays for short-read mappability and chromosome specificity.
              Because satellite DNAs evolve in a concerted manner, we use these
              centromeric assemblies to assess the extent of sequence variation
              among 366 individuals from distinct human populations. We thus
              identify two satellite array variants in both X and Y
              centromeres, as determined by array length and sequence
              composition. This study provides an initial sequence
              characterization of a regional centromere and establishes a
              foundation to extend genomic characterization to these sites as
              well as to other repeat-rich regions within complex genomes.",

              resolving allelic variation before assembly. In contrast with
              prior approaches, the effectiveness of our method improved with
              increasing heterozygosity. Trio binning uses short reads from two
              parental genomes to first partition long reads from an offspring
              into haplotype-specific sets. Each haplotype is then assembled

              alternative approaches. We sequenced an F1 cross between the

              completely assembled both parental haplotypes with NG50 haplotig

              challenging. We address these issues with Canu, a successor of
              Celera Assembler that is specifically designed for noisy
              single-molecule sequences. Canu introduces support for nanopore

              assembly continuity while simultaneously reducing runtime by an
              order of magnitude on large genomes versus Celera Assembler 8.2.
              These advances result from new overlapping and assembly
              algorithms, including an adaptive overlapping strategy based on
              tf-idf weighted MinHash and a sparse assembly graph construction

              previously revealed several prominent repeated DNA families
              defined by regularly spaced enzyme recognition sites. One of
              these families, termed alpha satellite DNA, was originally
              identified as tandemly repeated 340- or 680-base pair (bp) EcoRI
              fragments that hybridize to the centromeric regions of human
              chromosomes. We have investigated the molecular organization of
              alpha satellite DNA on individual human chromosomes by filter
              hybridization and in situ hybridization analysis of human DNA and
              DNA from rodent/human somatic cell hybrids, each containing only
              a single human chromosome. We used as probes a cloned 340-bp
              EcoRI alpha satellite fragment and a cloned alpha
              satellite-containing 2.0-kilobase pair (kbp) BamHI fragment from
              the pericentromeric region of the human X chromosome. In each
              somatic cell hybrid DNA, the two probes hybridized to a distinct
              subset of DNA fragments detected in total human genomic DNA.
              Thus, alpha satellite DNA on each of the human chromosomes
              examined--the X and Y chromosomes and autosomes 3, 4, and 21--is
              organized in a specific and limited number of molecular domains.
              The data indicate that subsets of alpha satellite DNA on
              individual chromosomes differ from one another, both with respect
              to restriction enzyme periodicities and with respect to their
              degree of sequence relatedness. The results suggest that some,
              and perhaps many, human chromosomes are characterized by a
              specific organization of alpha satellite DNA at their centromeres
              and that, under appropriate experimental conditions, cloned
              representatives of alpha satellite subfamilies may serve as a new
              class of chromosome-specific DNA markers.",

  abstract = "Somatic mutations accumulate in healthy tissues as we age, giving
              rise to cancer and potentially contributing to ageing. To study
              somatic mutations in non-neoplastic tissues, we developed a
              series of protocols to sequence the genomes of small populations
              of cells isolated from histological sections. Here, we describe a
              complete workflow that combines laser-capture microdissection
              (LCM) with low-input genome sequencing, while circumventing the
              use of whole-genome amplification (WGA). The protocol is
              subdivided broadly into four steps: tissue processing, LCM,
              low-input library generation and mutation calling and filtering.
              The tissue processing and LCM steps are provided as general
              guidelines that might require tailoring based on the specific
              requirements of the study at hand. Our protocol for low-input
              library generation uses enzymatic rather than acoustic
              fragmentation to generate WGA-free whole-genome libraries.
              Finally, the mutation calling and filtering strategy has been
              adapted from previously published protocols to account for
              artifacts introduced via library creation. To date, we have used
              this workflow to perform targeted and whole-genome sequencing of
              small populations of cells (typically 100-1,000 cells) in
              thousands of microbiopsies from a wide range of human tissues.
              The low-input DNA protocol is designed to be compatible with
              liquid handling platforms and make use of equipment and expertise
              standard to any core sequencing facility. However, obtaining
              low-input DNA material via LCM requires specialized equipment and
              expertise. The entire protocol from tissue reception through
              whole-genome library generation can be accomplished in as little
              as 1 week, although 2-3 weeks would be a more typical turnaround
              time.",

  abstract = "New sequencing technologies promise a new era in the use of DNA
              sequence. However, some of these technologies produce very short
              reads, typically of a few tens of base pairs, and to use these
              reads effectively requires new algorithms and software. In
              particular, there is a major issue in efficiently aligning short
              reads to a reference genome and handling ambiguity or lack of
              accuracy in this alignment. Here we introduce the concept of
              mapping quality, a measure of the confidence that a read actually
              comes from the position it is aligned to by the mapping
              algorithm. We describe the software MAQ that can build assemblies
              by mapping shotgun short reads to a reference genome, using
              quality scores to derive genotype calls of the consensus sequence
              of a diploid genome, e.g., from a human sample. MAQ makes full
              use of mate-pair information and estimates the error probability
              of each read alignment. Error probabilities are also derived for
              the final genotype calls, using a Bayesian statistical model that
              incorporates the mapping qualities, error probabilities from the
              raw sequence quality scores, sampling of the two haplotypes, and
              an empirical model for correlated errors at a site. Both read
              mapping and genotype calling are evaluated on simulated data and

              damaged cfDNA molecules using PreCR DNA repair mix. METHODS:
              cfDNA was extracted from 20 maternal plasma samples and was
              repaired and sequenced by the Illumina platform. Size profiles
              and fetal DNA fraction changes of repaired samples were
              characterized. Targeted sequencing of chromosome Y sequences was
              used to enrich fetal cfDNA molecules following repair.
              Single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing platform was employed
              to characterize long (>250 bp) cfDNA molecules. NIPT of five

              long (>250 bp) cfDNA molecules. Single nucleotide polymorphism
              (SNP)-based analyses showed that both fetal- and maternal-derived

              sequencing, we developed a methodology to directly examine 5mC.
              This approach holistically examined kinetic signals of a DNA
              polymerase (including interpulse duration and pulse width) and
              sequence context for every nucleotide within a measurement
              window, termed the holistic kinetic (HK) model. The measurement
              window of each analyzed double-stranded DNA molecule comprised 21
              nucleotides with a cytosine in a CpG site in the center. We used
              amplified DNA (unmethylated) and M.SssI-treated DNA (methylated)
              (M.SssI being a CpG methyltransferase) to train a convolutional

              tumor-normal sample pairs is becoming routine in cancer research.
              The consequent increased demand for somatic variant analysis of
              paired samples requires methods specialized to model this problem
              so as to sensitively call variants at any practical level of
              tumor impurity. RESULTS: We describe Strelka, a method for
              somatic SNV and small indel detection from sequencing data of
              matched tumor-normal samples. The method uses a novel Bayesian
              approach which represents continuous allele frequencies for both
              tumor and normal samples, while leveraging the expected genotype
              structure of the normal. This is achieved by representing the
              normal sample as a mixture of germline variation with noise, and
              representing the tumor sample as a mixture of the normal sample
              with somatic variation. A natural consequence of the model
              structure is that sensitivity can be maintained at high tumor

              sets generated by NGS--the 1000 Genome pilot alone includes

              in the scope and the ease with which they can answer scientific
              questions by the complexity of accessing and manipulating the
              data produced by these machines. Here, we discuss our Genome
              Analysis Toolkit (GATK), a structured programming framework
              designed to ease the development of efficient and robust analysis
              tools for next-generation DNA sequencers using the functional
              programming philosophy of MapReduce. The GATK provides a small

              functional decline after 70 years of age remains unclear. Here we
              sequenced 3,579 genomes from single cell-derived colonies of
              haematopoietic cells across 10 human subjects from 0 to 81 years
              of age. Haematopoietic stem cells or multipotent progenitors
              (HSC/MPPs) accumulated a mean of 17 mutations per year after
              birth and lost 30 base pairs per year of telomere length.
              Haematopoiesis in adults less than 65 years of age was massively
              polyclonal, with high clonal diversity and a stable population of
              20,000-200,000 HSC/MPPs contributing evenly to blood production.
              By contrast, haematopoiesis in individuals aged over 75 showed
              profoundly decreased clonal diversity. In each of the older
              subjects, 30-60\% of haematopoiesis was accounted for by 12-18
              independent clones, each contributing 1-34\% of blood production.
              Most clones had begun their expansion before the subject was 40
              years old, but only 22\% had known driver mutations. Genome-wide
              selection analysis estimated that between 1 in 34 and 1 in 12
              non-synonymous mutations were drivers, accruing at constant rates
              throughout life, affecting more genes than identified in blood
              cancers. Loss of the Y chromosome conferred selective benefits in
              males. Simulations of haematopoiesis, with constant stem cell
              population size and constant acquisition of driver mutations
              conferring moderate fitness benefits, entirely explained the
              abrupt change in clonal structure in the elderly. Rapidly
              decreasing clonal diversity is a universal feature of
              haematopoiesis in aged humans, underpinned by pervasive positive
              selection acting on many more genes than currently identified.",

              medicine and basic research. However, while this technology has
              the capacity to generate hundreds of billions of nucleotides of
              DNA sequence in a single experiment, the error rate of ~1\%
              results in hundreds of millions of sequencing mistakes. These
              scattered errors can be tolerated in some applications but become
              extremely problematic when ``deep sequencing'' genetically
              heterogeneous mixtures, such as tumors or mixed microbial
              populations. To overcome limitations in sequencing accuracy, we
              have developed a method termed Duplex Sequencing. This approach
              greatly reduces errors by independently tagging and sequencing
              each of the two strands of a DNA duplex. As the two strands are
              complementary, true mutations are found at the same position in
              both strands. In contrast, PCR or sequencing errors result in
              mutations in only one strand and can thus be discounted as
              technical error. We determine that Duplex Sequencing has a
              theoretical background error rate of less than one artifactual
              mutation per billion nucleotides sequenced. In addition, we
              establish that detection of mutations present in only one of the
              two strands of duplex DNA can be used to identify sites of DNA
              damage. We apply the method to directly assess the frequency and

              modifications ranging from thousands of single base changes to
              megabase-scale path reorganizations, gap closures, and
              localization of previously orphaned sequences. We developed a new
              approach to sequence generation for targeted base updates and
              used data from new genome mapping technologies and single
              haplotype resources to identify and resolve larger assembly
              issues. For the first time, the reference assembly contains
              sequence-based representations for the centromeres. We also

              provides a more robust representation of human population

              present in single cells or small clones has limited our knowledge
              of somatic mutagenesis to a minority of tissues. Here, to
              overcome these limitations, we developed nanorate sequencing
              (NanoSeq), a duplex sequencing protocol with error rates of less
              than five errors per billion base pairs in single DNA molecules
              from cell populations. This rate is two orders of magnitude lower
              than typical somatic mutation loads, enabling the study of
              somatic mutations in any tissue independently of clonality. We
              used this single-molecule sensitivity to study somatic mutations
              in non-dividing cells across several tissues, comparing stem
              cells to differentiated cells and studying mutagenesis in the
              absence of cell division. Differentiated cells in blood and colon
              displayed remarkably similar mutation loads and signatures to
              their corresponding stem cells, despite mature blood cells having
              undergone considerably more divisions. We then characterized the
              mutational landscape of post-mitotic neurons and polyclonal
              smooth muscle, confirming that neurons accumulate somatic
              mutations at a constant rate throughout life without cell
              division, with similar rates to mitotically active tissues.
              Together, our results suggest that mutational processes that are
              independent of cell division are important contributors to
              somatic mutagenesis. We anticipate that the ability to reliably
              detect mutations in single DNA molecules could transform our
              understanding of somatic mutagenesis and enable non-invasive
              studies on large-scale cohorts.",

              One milestone towards this objective is the identification of all
              the genes with mutations capable of driving tumours. Since the
              1970s, the list of cancer genes has been growing steadily.
              Because cancer driver genes are under positive selection in
              tumorigenesis, their observed patterns of somatic mutations
              across tumours in a cohort deviate from those expected from
              neutral mutagenesis. These deviations, which constitute signals
              of positive selection, may be detected by carefully designed
              bioinformatics methods, which have become the state of the art in
              the identification of driver genes. A systematic approach
              combining several of these signals could lead to a compendium of
              mutational cancer genes. In this Review, we present the

              tumours of 66 cancer types reveals 568 cancer genes and points
              towards their mechanisms of tumorigenesis. The application of
              this approach to the ever-growing datasets of somatic tumour

              The consequent increased demand for somatic variant analysis of
              paired samples requires methods specialized to model this problem
              so as to sensitively call variants at any practical level of
              tumor impurity. RESULTS: We describe Strelka, a method for
              somatic SNV and small indel detection from sequencing data of
              matched tumor-normal samples. The method uses a novel Bayesian
              approach which represents continuous allele frequencies for both
              tumor and normal samples, while leveraging the expected genotype
              structure of the normal. This is achieved by representing the
              normal sample as a mixture of germline variation with noise, and
              representing the tumor sample as a mixture of the normal sample
              with somatic variation. A natural consequence of the model
              structure is that sensitivity can be maintained at high tumor

  abstract = "Mutations generate sequence diversity and provide a substrate for
              selection. The rate of de novo mutations is therefore of major
              importance to evolution. Here we conduct a study of genome-wide
              mutation rates by sequencing the entire genomes of 78 Icelandic
              parent-offspring trios at high coverage. We show that in our
              samples, with an average father's age of 29.7, the average de
              novo mutation rate is 1.20 $\times$ 10(-8) per nucleotide per
              generation. Most notably, the diversity in mutation rate of
              single nucleotide polymorphisms is dominated by the age of the
              father at conception of the child. The effect is an increase of
              about two mutations per year. An exponential model estimates
              paternal mutations doubling every 16.5 years. After accounting
              for random Poisson variation, father's age is estimated to
              explain nearly all of the remaining variation in the de novo
              mutation counts. These observations shed light on the importance
              of the father's age on the risk of diseases such as schizophrenia
              and autism.",

  abstract = "Meiosis, although essential for reproduction, is also variable
              and error-prone: rates of chromosome crossover vary among
              gametes, between the sexes, and among humans of the same sex, and
              chromosome missegregation leads to abnormal chromosome numbers
              (aneuploidy)1-8. To study diverse meiotic outcomes and how they
              covary across chromosomes, gametes and humans, we developed
              Sperm-seq, a way of simultaneously analysing the genomes of
              thousands of individual sperm. Here we analyse the genomes of
              31,228 human gametes from 20 sperm donors, identifying 813,122
              crossovers and 787 aneuploid chromosomes. Sperm donors had
              aneuploidy rates ranging from 0.01 to 0.05 aneuploidies per
              gamete; crossovers partially protected chromosomes from
              nondisjunction at the meiosis I cell division. Some chromosomes
              and donors underwent more-frequent nondisjunction during meiosis
              I, and others showed more meiosis II segregation failures. Sperm
              genomes also manifested many genomic anomalies that could not be
              explained by simple nondisjunction. Diverse recombination
              phenotypes-from crossover rates to crossover location and
              separation, a measure of crossover interference-covaried strongly
              across individuals and cells. Our results can be incorporated
              with earlier observations into a unified model in which a core
              mechanism, the variable physical compaction of meiotic
              chromosomes, generates interindividual and cell-to-cell variation
              in diverse meiotic phenotypes.",
